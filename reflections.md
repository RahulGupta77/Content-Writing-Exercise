# Article Feedback - Functions in JavaScript

## A. Challenges you encountered while writing the article

While writing the article on JavaScript functions, one of the main challenges I faced was ensuring that the examples were unique and not similar to commonly found code snippets online. It required a creative approach to write meaningful and realistic examples that demonstrate different concepts without repeating standard textbook cases. Additionally, I had to ensure that the content was organized logically, making it comprehensive for readers with varying levels of JavaScript experience.

## B. The decisions that you made about what to include or exclude from your article

When deciding what to include, I focused on covering the essential aspects of JavaScript functions, such as function declarations, expressions, arrow functions, and common features like default parameters and rest parameters. I also included a section on higher-order functions to provide a deeper understanding for readers interested in advanced topics.

I chose to exclude more complex topics such as asynchronous functions, closures, and recursion, as these could significantly extend the scope of the article. My aim was to maintain a balance between providing enough detail for beginners and not overwhelming them with too many advanced concepts at once.

## C. Where you would want feedback on your article

I would appreciate feedback on the overall flow of the article, particularly on how the concepts are introduced and explained. I'm also interested in knowing if the code examples are clear and effective in demonstrating the intended topics. Additionally, any suggestions on improving the readability and structure of the explanations would be helpful.

## D. Additional improvements you would have made if you had more time

If I had more time, I would have incorporated visual diagrams to illustrate the flow of function calls, the difference between hoisting in function declarations vs. function expressions, and the behavior of `this` in arrow functions. Using a tool like Excalidraw, I could have created custom diagrams to visually represent these concepts, making the explanations easier to understand and more engaging for readers.

## E. Use of Generative AI Tools for the Assignment

### i. The prompt(s) you provided the tool

Yes, I have used generative AI tools like Claude AI, and Perplexity to assist me in crafting and refining the article on JavaScript functions. Here is prompt that I used:

**Prompt:**
"Write a comprehensive guide on JavaScript functions, including function declarations, function expressions, arrow functions, rest parameters, and higher-order functions. Make sure the examples are unique and avoid copying standard textbook examples. Keep it professional and logically structured."

### ii. The response(s) you got back from the tool

**Response:**
The tool provided a structured article with various sections explaining JavaScript functions. It included content on function declarations, expressions, and arrow functions, as well as code examples demonstrating each concept. The response was well-organized, with additional information on default parameters, rest parameters, and the advantages and disadvantages of arrow functions.

**Example Snippet from Response:**

"JavaScript supports higher-order functions, which can accept other functions as arguments or return them. For example:

```javascript
function applyDiscount(price, discountFunction) {
  return discountFunction(price);
}

const halfOff = (price) => price * 0.5;

console.log(applyDiscount(200, halfOff)); // Output: 100
```

### iii. What you distinctly changed about the response

While the AI-generated response provided a good starting point, I made several adjustments to ensure originality and relevance:

1. **Unique Examples:** I created entirely new examples that were more contextual and relevant to common use cases in web development. I avoided using any examples that were overly generic or found frequently in documentation.
2. **Reorganization:** I restructured the flow of the article, deciding on the order of concepts to make it more logical and easier for readers to follow, starting from basic function concepts to more advanced topics like higher-order functions.
3. **Content Enhancement:** I added additional explanations, including comparisons between function declarations, expressions, and arrow functions, and included a detailed table summarizing their differences.
4. **Quality Check:** I manually reviewed the content for accuracy, ensuring that explanations were clear and concise, and corrected any minor errors or inconsistencies.

### iv. Why you chose to use the tool

I chose to use these AI tools as a source of inspiration and to help streamline the initial drafting process. Given the wide scope of topics covered in JavaScript functions, leveraging generative AI allowed me to quickly gather ideas and structure the article effectively. However, I made sure to thoroughly revise and refine the content, ensuring that it was tailored to my specific needs and avoided direct plagiarism. This approach helped me focus more on the quality and depth of the content rather than spending excessive time on basic structuring.

Overall, using generative AI tools allowed me to produce a well-rounded and informative article, but I took care to apply my own understanding, unique examples, and enhancements, resulting in a final product that is both original and comprehensive.
